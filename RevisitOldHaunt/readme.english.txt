Revisit The Old Haunt
Teleporting to areas you've already visited by casting the spell Wish or Limited Wish. This may affect the Quest process, so it is better to travel to and from an area after the main Quest in which has been completed.
This MOD is learned from a certain MOD with unknown sources, yet the areas supported in my one are no longer limited to the original game areas, but include various MOD areas. It needs to be installed after all MODs with new areas.
If it was installed halfway through the game process, each area must be visited again to make a transfer destination.
